# README Generator

# Purpose
Use Node.js and Inquirer to create a professional readme generator.

# Acceptance Criteria
- When prompted for info about your project, a high-quality readme is generated with the following sections: Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.
- The project title is the title of the readme.
- Inputted information is added to their respective sections of the readme.
- Badges are added for licenses the application is covered under.
- Github profile and email are linked in the "Questions" section
- The table of contents links to its corresponding sections. 

# Struggles Encountered
- As of right now, this project is incomplete! I still need license badges and to fix up some sections and link to github profile, but I've had a rough couple of weeks. Will update soon!!

# Usage
Install by typing "npm init" then "npm install inquirer" into your terminal.
Type node index and then answer the prompts fully
